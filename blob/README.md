Replaces most of the music in supported games by [Thomas Light](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCstM7ToXNepL-TZxiuRZ21w)'s Blob Opera renditions.<br>Also includes a few cheeky graphical changes for the title screen and the song names.

#### Install Guide:

Blob Patch is a thcrap patch. If you've never used thcrap, first [download](https://www.thpatch.net/wiki/Touhou_Patch_Center:Download) the latest version of the patcher and run `thcrap.exe`. On the patch selection screen, click `Advanced mode...` and scroll down to my patch list (Guy's patches), select the first one and continue. Point thcrap to the location of your games folder, create the shortcuts you want, and wait for the download to finish. You can now run the patch.

#### To Do:
- Support for other games is possible if anyone wants it. I might do it on my own if I start grinding any game enough for this to be helpful.
- The ending, credits and game over songs are not currently changed as I wasn't provided a blob version for these.
- The audio files are a lot bigger than they need to be given their actual quality level (please excuse the artifacts, they seem to be inherent to Blob Opera's audio rendering). They should be compressed.
