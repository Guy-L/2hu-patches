Replaces most of the music in supported games by [Thomas Light](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCstM7ToXNepL-TZxiuRZ21w)'s Blob Opera renditions.
Also includes a few cheeky graphical changes for the title screen and the song names.

#### To Do:
- Support for other games is possible if anyone wants it. I might do it on my own if I start grinding any game enough for this to be helpful.
- The ending, credits and game over songs are not currently changed as I wasn't provided a blob version for these.
- The audio files are a lot bigger than they need to be given their actual quality level (please excuse the artifacts, they seem to be inherent to Blob Opera's audio rendering). They should be compressed.
